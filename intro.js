ABOUT ME

Welcome to my website. I had a lot of fun building it. I'm sure a real developer would faint at the mere sight of my code, but it is my code and I'm proud of it.

My name is Frédéric, and I have been involved in the restaurant industry for close to 15 years. I am currently orchestrating a career change from food & hospitality to IT and cybersecurity.

The first step I am taking is following a technical program at a local college. This will give me a solid beginner's foundation and seven industry certifications to refine my direction.

I am currently accepting offers for entry-level positions, mainly in technical support or helpdesk-related environments.
